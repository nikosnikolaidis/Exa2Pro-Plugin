<h1>Metrics-Refactorings</h1>
<p>The Metrics view is a table where all the calculated metrics (FanOut, Cohesion, Cyclomatic Complexity, and Lines of Code) are stored. In this view, there are 3 options in order to show the file metrics or the method/function metrics. The user can change the option through right-clicking inside this view or by using the icons in the toolbar, for file and method/function metrics respectively.</p>
<p>The third option is the general metrics of the project. Here are visible the system metrics and the TD of the overall project (Source Code Debt, Design Debt, TD Interest).</p>

<p>In the Refactorings view, there are all the files and methods/functions in need of some kind of refactoring because of a very high metric value. With the threshold of a hight metric value being the upper 10% of metric distribution, considering all analyzed projects. In this view, there are four different options, one for each metric, which can be changed through a right-click inside the view or by the icons on the toolbar.</p>
<p>Moreover, the user can start the TD repayment process from here, in the Cohesion Files option, one can double click a file in order to start the process of finding specific opportunities for refactorings.</p>
