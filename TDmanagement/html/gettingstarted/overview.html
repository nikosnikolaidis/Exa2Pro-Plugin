<h1>Overview</h1>

<h3>Exa2pro vision</h3>
<p>The vision of EXA2PRO is to develop a programming environment that will enable the productive deployment of highly parallel applications in exascale computing systems.</p>

<h3>Technical Debt</h3>
<p>Technical debt(TD) is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional work caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer to implement</p>
<p>This metaphor can be used in HPC as well</p>

<h3>Tool and Plugin</h3>
<p>We created a tool with a graphical user interface as well as this eclipse plugin in order to manage the TD in the most common programming languages of HPC (Fortran, C, and C++)</p>
<p>Our tool and plugin calculate the metrics and TD as is shown in the next figure, so you will need to have access to a SonarQube installation.</p>
