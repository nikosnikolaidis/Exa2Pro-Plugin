<h1>Preferences</h1>
<p>Eclipse IDE can be customized through the Preference window and it is possible to create a plugin that it can be customized in the same way. By navigating through the menu “Window” and then selecting “Preferences” one can see the new TD Preferences page (see Figure).</p>
<p>The analysis of a project consists of two parts: 1) the calculation of the design smells (the metrics), and 2) the identification of code smells (the rule violations). As the identification of rule violations is possible with the help of SonarQube, we created the possibility of analysis only for design smells. In order to use SonarQube, some additional information should be provided, that’s why the default option is not a complete scan. From that page, the user can select if he wants to use SonarQube or not, and provide the required information of SonarQube URL, the SonarScanner path and iCode path. This customization should be the first thing he/she has to do, in order to access the full potential of the TD management, with the use of a complete scan.</p>
<p>For the analysis of Fortran files the files should be created in a unix format, which is required from the sonar plugin (iCode). For this reason the user should also provide if she/he wants the external tool dos2unix.exe to not have to worry about the format of the files.</p>
<p>Moreover, the user can select the way in which the tool is going to find the possible opportunities for refactorings. By activating the “Faster Opportunity extractor” the tool is going to use the modified version of SEMI but at a risk of losing some extract method suggestions. On the other hand, by not activating that option the initial algorithm of SEMI is going to be used with better results but with the need for more execution time.</p>
<p>Also, the user should provide the clustering and td-forecaster folders of our project. Because these external scrips are written in the programming language Python, the user is required to provide the String that he/she uses to run such scrips (python, python3.7). Moreover, to customize the clustering threshold that is being used for the clustering algorithm, can also be changed from here. The simplified rule is that with low values the extract files are more in number, and as the threshold value is being increased the extract files decrease. (min=0.01 max=0.99)</p>
